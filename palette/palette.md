# Palette
All game art is made with the 32 colors in this palette. Using a limited palette creates a harmonious feel throughout the game, and speeds up the drawing process. These colors are sourced from [DawnBringer's 32-Color Palette](http://pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=16247). The colors are named with names from [db32.gpl](http://privat.bahnhof.se/wb364826/pic/db32.gpl) or a close matching alternative name from [Name that Color](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color).

The author is red/green color blind and finds it very helpful to include the name of the base hue in the color where the name is otherwise ambiguous (e.g., Lemon is obviously yellow, but Hawkes is called Hawkes Blue).

The colors were also reorganized to group similar hues together. This may be a creativity no-no, but again, it's helpful in locating similar hues quickly.

There are certainly times where it seems that a color is missing from this limited set, but that's the time to push creativity -- not add a new color.
